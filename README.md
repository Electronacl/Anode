# Anode
An emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System

## Project goals
My aim with this emulator is for an accurate NES system compatible with both PAL and NTSC. Just to make it a little easier at first, the emulator will only support NTSC, but PAL support is going to be added later.

## Known issues
I haven't uploaded code yet, so none atm.

## Language support
This program is only built with British English as a language, however the addition of other languages is planned for the future.
