# Anode
An emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System

## Project goals
My aim with this emulator is for an accurate NES system compatible with both PAL and NTSC. Just to make it a little easier at first, the emulator will only support NTSC, but PAL support is going to be added later.

## Known issues
I haven't uploaded code yet, so none atm.

## Language support
This program is only built with British English as a language, however the addition of other languages is planned for the future.

## Emulation and legality
Whilst it is legal to use - and for me to create - this emulator, that only applies if the ROMs are legal. I am not responsible for the ROMs used by any users on this emulator. For legal reasons, these ROMs should be from your own NES game library and obtained via a cartridge dumper, or alternatively from open-source ROMs. This emulator is only intended to work with legal ROMs.
This emulator does not come with any games or test programs.
